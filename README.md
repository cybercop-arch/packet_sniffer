# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Packet Sniffer (Your Own Little Wireshark)

A **simple Python-based packet sniffer** built using **Scapy** and **raw sockets**. It captures raw packets directly from the link layer, allowing you to monitor all incoming and outgoing traffic on a specific network interface (like `eth0`).

---

## üì¶ Features

- üß† Captures **raw Ethernet frames** using sockets
- üåê Converts and parses packets using **Scapy**
- üì• Displays packet summaries in real-time
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Minimal and lightweight ‚Äì no GUI, pure CLI
- üõë Graceful exit with `Ctrl+C`

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
packet-sniffer/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packet\_sniffer.py      # Main script to capture and display network packets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Dependencies

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Linux or WSL (for raw socket permissions)
- Must be run with **sudo/root privileges**
- Install dependencies:
  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

**`requirements.txt`**

```
scapy

## üöÄ Usage

### üõ† Step 1: Choose your network interface

Edit this line in `packet_sniffer.py` if you're not using `eth0`:

```python
interface = "eth0"
```

To list all interfaces on your system:

```bash
ip link show
```

---

### üß™ Step 2: Run the sniffer with root privileges

```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
```

It will start printing a summary of every packet captured:

```
Ether / IP / TCP 192.168.0.5:443 > 192.168.0.10:58235 S
Ether / ARP who has 192.168.0.1 says 192.168.0.2
Ether / IP / ICMP echo request 192.168.0.10 > 8.8.8.8
...
```

Stop the capture using `Ctrl+C`.

---

## üß† How It Works

* `AF_PACKET` and `SOCK_RAW`: Captures raw data directly from the link layer.
* `sniffer_socket.recvfrom(65535)`: Reads every packet received on the interface.
* `Ether(raw_data)`: Converts the raw bytes into a Scapy-readable packet.
* `packet.summary()`: Displays a concise, one-line summary of the packet.

## üîê Note on Permissions

Raw sockets require administrative privileges. Always run this tool with:

```bash
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
```

## üí¨ Example Output

```bash
Ether / IP / TCP 192.168.1.5:443 > 192.168.1.2:54123 S
Ether / ARP who has 192.168.1.1 says 192.168.1.254
Ether / IP / UDP 192.168.1.2:5353 > 224.0.0.251:5353
```

## üß∞ Future Ideas

* Add filtering by protocol (e.g., only show TCP or HTTP)
* Save packets to a `.pcap` file
* Implement a basic GUI or web dashboard
* Add timestamping and colored output
